There's a lot of specific info about single Vim and Neovim issues like plugin managers, LSPs etc.

BUT not enough info about THE BIG PICTURE, the full Vim and Neovim roadmap!

So, let me give you THE BIG PICTURE:

## tl;dr - the summary

The situation: You’re coding in an IDE like VS Code, IntelliJ, Emacs or whatever else. Now you're saying, “I want to try Vim but I don’t know where to start.”

- Use [Vim in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-product-as-the-vim-editor.html) or whatever your current IDE is to see if you like it. If you do and you want the full Vim in Neovim experience, then
- A) build your own Neovim config if you’re an advanced programmer or
- B) use a Neovim distribution, a so called “distro”. That is an out of the box Neovim configuration that includes everything you need, so you can start coding right away. I highly recommend the [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) distro.
- For keyboard-only navigation in the browser use [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) in Chrome and Firefox.
- For keyboard-only navigation on your OS use [Fluent Search](https://fluentsearch.net/) on Windows and [Homerow](https://www.homerow.app/) on Mac.

## The problem: Navigating a decentralized, innovative ecosystem

Neovim is a fork of Vim
goal: making Vim more customizable and extensible

blooming ecosystem
advantage: innovation and many sources of information
disadvantage: finding your way through the Neovim jungle

## Why Vim? And what makes it so good?

Vim is tailored to navigating and editing text as efficiently as possible

coding without Vim will feel like editing code in Word

Examples: efficient multi-line editing, quick navigation of big codebases

## Distro or building your own config?

for advanced programmers: build your own Neovim config
for beginners and intermediate p.: use distro

Or even still use a distro if you're an advanced programmer!

## Know why! Understand the concepts, don’t just memorize the motions

examples:

understand that 'a' stands for 'append', meaning “to add something to the end of a piece of writing” (Cambridge)\
'a' adds sth. to end of a line\
'a' creates file with Neo-tree plugin

in RegEx $ indicates end of a string\
use '$' in Vim to jump to the end of a line

## Vim navigation in the Browser

jumping with search labels

plugins [flash](https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim) and [leap](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim)
Chrome and Firefox extension [Vimium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb)

## Vim navigation on Windows and Apple devices

for Windows I use [Fluent Search](https://fluentsearch.net/)

for Mac I recommend [Homerow](https://www.homerow.app/).
